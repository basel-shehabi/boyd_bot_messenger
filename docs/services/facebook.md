# [Facebook Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/products/messenger/)

Implemented in _class_ `Platform` without using any Facebook package. This app also integrates to Facebook Messenger as its messaging service / platform. This platform was the most preferred since it's a common app used by university students and it can be used on desktop as well.
